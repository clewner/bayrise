        <p class="enrichmentparagraph">We offer free computer science enrichment classes to disadvantaged youths and young adults, empowering them with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the digital age.

By bridging the opportunity gap through accessible education, we aim to create a more equitable future for all.</p>

        <div class="codingcontainer">
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Age Range</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">Because computer science has such a broad age range, we teach younger kids (9-12), younger teens (13-15), and even young adults (16-20)</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Who we work with</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">We teach our classes wherever we think kids or young adults can benefit from these added learning opportunities. We've partnered with schools, other non-profit organizations, and even groups of individuals.</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Pricing (Free!)</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">Our classes are completely free, and all materials are provided because we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and succeed. In fact, we leave a laptop with every group of disadvantaged kids we teach. That way, they can continue their projects and learning even when we aren't there.</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Sign Up</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">If you or your group is interested in any of our classes, contact us here.</p>
