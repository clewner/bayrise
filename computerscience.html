                <p class="enrichmentparagraph">We offer free computer science enrichment classes to disadvantaged youths and young adults, empowering them with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the digital age. We strive to foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students can explore their passions, develop critical thinking skills, and gain confidence in their abilities. By bridging the opportunity gap through accessible education, we aim to create a more equitable future for all.</p>

        <div class="codingcontainer">
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Age Range</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">Because computer science has such a broad age range, we teach younger kids (9-12), younger teens (13-15), and even young adults (16-20)</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Who we work with</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">We teach our classes wherever we think kids or young adults can benefit from these added learning opportunities. We've partnered with schools, other non-profit organizations, and even groups of individuals.</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Pricing (Free!)</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">Our classes are completely free, and all materials are provided because we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and succeed. In fact, we leave a laptop with every group of disadvantaged kids we teach. That way, they can continue their projects and learning even when we aren't there.</p>
            <h1 class="codinginfohead">Sign Up</h1>
            <p class="codinginfopar">If you or your group is interested in any of our classes, contact us here.</p>

            <h1 class="codinginfoheadleft">Curricula</h1>
            <p class="codinginfosmallhead">Younger Kids (9-12):</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">For younger kids, we provide an introduction to coding through Scratch, an easy-to-use block coding language developed by the MIT Media Lab.</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">Students start with learning basic game development concepts like the coordinate plane, level and character design, and integrating online assets into their projects. Then, they move on to learning some basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and variables. 
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">We encourage students to explore their creativity by designing and developing their own games and animations. This way, we provide a fun and interactive way for younger kids to learn coding while building problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking skills along the way.</p>

            <p class="codinginfosmallhead">Younger Teens (13-15):</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">For younger teens, we focus on teaching the Python programming language, which is widely used in various industries such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, and web development.</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">Students start with learning the basic syntax and data types in Python, as well as fundamental programing concepts like loops, conditionals and variables. Then they move on to more advanced concepts like using APIs, file I/O, and web scraping.</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">They will work on projects like creating a weather app, building a chatbot, or developing a game. By the end of the program, students will have a solid understanding of Python and the confidence to continue exploring more advanced programming concepts on their own.</p>

            <p class="codinginfosmallhead">Young Adults (16-20):</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">For young adults, we focus on teaching web development in the HTML, CSS and Javascript to help students become more job ready in an industry that is experiencing an increasingly high demand.</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">Students start with learning the basic structure of a website in HTML, including tags, attributes and elements. From there, they move on to CSS, where they learn how to style and layout web pages using properties like color, font, and positioning. As students progress, they learn more advanced concepts like Javascript programming, including functions, objects, and event listeners. Additionally, they learn about integrating external libraries and frameworks into their projects, which can greatly enhance the functionality and visual appeal of their web applications.</p>
            <p class="codinginfoparleft">They will work on real-world projects like responsive websites, interactive user interfaces, or web-based games. By the end of the program, students will have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and will have the confidence to continue exploring more advanced web development concepts on their own. These skills are highly transferable and can be applied to a wide range of careers in the tech industry, making our program an excellent choice for those seeking a career in web development.</p>
