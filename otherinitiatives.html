            <h1>Bimonthly Warming Campaign</h1>
            <p>Every two months we work with NorthEast Fleece and CheapWinterDeals to get charity discounts and buy blankets and warm clothes in bulk with money we get from fundraisers. We then distribute the items to unhoused people in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco through soup kitchens, community centers, and homeless shelters.</p>
